message=any wogs into an asian girl? I see a few lifting at uni gym, but I don't want to disturb their session so I never approach them. I just steal glances from the treadmills wondering if all that lifting means they could roughhouse me too. \n\nDon't know if it's the guys or the exercise that makes me more thirsty.
