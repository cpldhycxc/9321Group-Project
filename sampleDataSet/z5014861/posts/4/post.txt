message=To a boy who shares a name with a city,\nWhose hair is bright as a blazing fire,\nYour eyes are calm and blue as the ocean,\nIn them I drown deep in desire.\n\nUnrequited I expect I'll be;\nIn a fair maiden's arms he does reside,\nBut I'll always feel a jolt & a spark,\nWhen our paths in life do collide.
